# Automating the Perfect Bridge

Building a *bridge of spaghetti* isn’t just about structural integrity — it’s a test of automation, creativity, and patience.

In this project, we combined **industrial automation** with **materials engineering** to produce the most elegant (and edible) bridge prototype yet.

## Design Process

The following render shows our first digital prototype:

  width={2557}
  height={1704}
/>

We started by simulating the load-bearing properties of spaghetti strands using a basic finite element analysis. This allowed us to optimize the geometry before even touching the pasta.

## Automation Setup

Our automation rig was driven by a custom PLC program. Below is a photo of the assembly line taken during testing:

This setup allowed consistent glue application, reducing structural inconsistencies by over **30%**.

---

## Results

The final bridge held **8.3 kg**, surpassing our previous record.
We’re currently refining the sensor calibration to improve precision in glue placement.

## Next Steps

1. Add computer vision feedback loops.
2. Explore alternative pasta materials (gluten-free, whole wheat).
3. Train a small ML model for failure prediction.
